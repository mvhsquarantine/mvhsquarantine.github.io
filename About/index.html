            <p class = "paragraph">During the quarantine, the freshman cabinet wanted to find ways to include and engage the student body. To solve this problem, we decided to take action by organizing different activities led by student teachers on zoom calls throughout the week. By getting some developers on the job, we were able to create a website to make the organization process easier (by Jason Zhang, Saarang Bondalapati, Jacob Ismael, and Atli Arnarsson).</p>
            <h1 class = "center">Who can join the meetings?</h1>
